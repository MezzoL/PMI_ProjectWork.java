Hello Welcome to my project.
In here we manage your bank accounts, you can open a new bank account, edit an old one or delete an unused one.
consider yourself a bank owner and these are your clients its like bank manager simulator.
everything is saved in an xml file.

Run: Economics
we already have 2 clients registered, each client that we have is given a random index number
the index is used to identify them when they open a bank account at our bank in case of name edits if there was a typo or if they want to delete the bank account
after all is done you can exit by just using 0 and the xml file will be updated with all the new data you might've added when you ran the program
if you close the program without using our exit feature non of your data will be saved

If any further information is required please use our Javadoc
